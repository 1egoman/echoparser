# echoparser

After messing with an Amazon Echo I think that it could use some work. The problem is their skills api really 
won't let me do what I want (no `ask bla to ...`).

So, I'm trying to see if I can implement the same algorithms myself. After analyzing both the skills api and 
querying the echo I think I've cracked it.

Still a few unanswered questions though:
- How does the echo do maths? (`alexa, one plus one`)
